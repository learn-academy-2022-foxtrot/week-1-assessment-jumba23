# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a version control software used on local computer. GitHub is version control software cloud based.

Researched answer: Git is a version control system that allows you to track source code history. GitHub is cloud based service that allows you to manage repositories and keep track of them. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Logical operators

Researched answer: Logical operators AND, OR and  NOT

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: Index refers to position/location of an element in an array, or a string. Value refers to the information/data in a specific location.
It is like an address where somebody lives. The address will be in order and never change, while people living there (values) can change.

Researched answer: Index is READ-ONLY property and it starts with 0. The value is the information stored in an element.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings.

Your answer: Array are similar to strings but not quite the same. Strings do not have some very useful methods arrays have. Arrays can hold elements of any value/kind, while string can only hold characters.

Researched answer: The main difference is in data structure. Arrays structure holds a collection of elements with having the same data types. In essence, string is an array but it only stores characters. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Driver is in charge of typing and screen sharing. Navigator is providing the instructions to the driver.

Researched answer: Driver: Uses keyboard, mouse, and manages editor. Navigator: is doing the thinking, advising, catching errors, typos, etc.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: can receive another function as an argument or return a new function, or both. 

2. Jest: is JavaScript testing framework. It is primarily built to work with React. Jest can run different test that do not influence each other's results. It has approachable, familiar, and feature rich API.

3. Objects: are stand alone entities with an unordered list of key-value pairs. Each key-value is called a property. Objects can hold multiple values in terms of properties and methods. 

4. Method: is a function stored as an object property.  

5. Classes: are similar to functions in JS. They are considered as blueprint for objects. Just like functions they have declarations and expressions, but unlike functions they must be declared before they can be used.
